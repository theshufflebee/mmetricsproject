"],["abstract.html", "Chapter 2 Abstract", " Chapter 2 Abstract This Project assesses to what extent Financial Markets react to information provided by Donald Trump on either Twitter (now known as X) and Truth Social. We asses the impact of posts on hourly volatility using ARMA-X. We evaluate multimple tie horizons and independent variables, such as if Trump posts anything, specific words such as tariff and sentiments. We then calculate IRFS and show that there are significant impacts on volatility.

Its importance lies at the core of the “Perfect Market Hypothesis” (PMH), which states that the prices of assets fully reflect all available information, adjusting immediately to any new data (2), and thereby creating a strong demand for information flow. In addition, the “Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis” states that the release of new information is closely linked to mouvements in both realized and implied volatility (1)(3)(7). Consequently, a large part of the literature had focused on the relation between announcements, news and market activity. For example, Schumaker and Shen (4) use various linguistic and textual representations derived from financial news to predict stock market prices. Similarly, Ederington and Lee (5) analyze the impact of macroeconomic news announcements on interest rate and foreign exchange futures markets, particularly in terms of price changes and volatility. Both studies, among others, find that prices— such as stock prices—react primarily within minutes after the release of new information (4)(5). Recently, the world has witnessed the rise of the Internet which revolutionized the dissemination and accessibility of information. Social media enable investors, analysts or politicians to instantly share their information, news or opinions. This led some studies to focus on the communication dynamics of social platform to predict changes in the returns of financial assets (6)(8). In this context, the impact of Trump’s tweets on various financial and macroeconomic variables has been analysed by several studies, especially during his first mandate. Using high-frequency financial data, Gjerstad et al.  (y) found an increase in uncertainty and trading volume, along with a decline in the U.S. stock market—regardless of the tweet’s content. However, the effect was stronger when Trump used confrontational words such as “tariff” or “trade war.” Some of his announcements also influenced the U.S. dollar exchange rate (l) and certain market indices within minutes of the tweet being posted (r)(a). Other scholars have shown that negative Trump’s tweets about specific companies tended to reduce demand for their stocks (b)(g), whereas some other have shown that they also impact market volatility indices such as the VIX (w) or the Volfele(v). The effects of his tweets also extended beyond the U.S.. For example, Sun and al. shows a positive relationship between volatility in European stock markets and tweeter activity of Trump, and this effect tends to intensify as public intention for his tweet grows (z).

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 4. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 4.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The bs4_book theme makes footnotes appear inline when you click on them. In this example book, we added csl: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl to the index.Rmd YAML, and include the .csl file.

To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This bs4_book provides enhanced metadata for social sharing, so that each chapter shared will have a unique description, auto-generated based on the content. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub as the repo in the _output.yml file, which allows users to view each chapter’s source file or suggest an edit.
