We asses the impact of posts on hourly volatility using ARMA-X. We evaluate multimple tie horizons and independent variables, such as if Trump posts anything, specific words such as tariff and sentiments. We then calculate IRFS and show that there are significant impacts on volatility.

One of the pioneers of this novel approach has been Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th Presiden of the United States. While he has been posting a lot online, he has increased posting enourmously since he was banned from twitter after the Jan 6th riots. This is on his own social media platform. As shown below he as been posting constantly. 1 Especially in his second term he has been active on Truth Social for long periods of time, often announcing or teasing important political decision on there. Especially his announcement of “Now is a good time to buy an hour before lifting reciprocal tariffs and him announcing his post important Truth Social Post before Posting about price controls lend to the fact that this has now become a major source of information. Therefore the question wether financial markets react to these posts has been discussed plenty. We investigate two research questions. Do Donald Trumps Posts impact market Volatility? Have traders learned from past actions and are now more reactive than they were during his first term? 1.1 Figure 1.1: Terminally Online: Trump’s Twitter &amp; Truth Social Posts (EDT) 1.1 Literature Review Information is one of the most valuable assets in the financial market. Its importance lies at the core of the “Perfect Market Hypothesis” (PMH), which states that the prices of assets fully reflect all available information, adjusting immediately to any new data Fama et al. (2003) , and thereby creating a strong demand for information flow. In addition, the “Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis” states that the release of new information is closely linked to movements in both realized and implied volatility (1)(3)(7). Consequently, a large part of the literature had focused on the relation between announcements, news and market activity. For example, Schumaker &amp; Chen (2009) use various linguistic and textual representations derived from financial news to predict stock market prices. Similarly, Ederington &amp; Lee (1993) analyze the impact of macroeconomic news announcements on interest rate and foreign exchange futures markets, particularly in terms of price changes and volatility. Both studies, among others, find that prices— such as stock prices—react primarily within minutes after the release of new information. Recently, the world has witnessed the rise of the Internet which revolutionized the dissemination and accessibility of information. Social media enable investors, analysts or politicians to instantly share their information, news or opinions. This led some studies to focus on the communication dynamics of social platform to predict changes in the returns of financial assets (6)(8). In this context, the impact of Trump’s tweets on various financial and macroeconomic variables has been analysed by several studies, especially during his first mandate. Using high-frequency financial data, Gjerstad et al. (2021) found an increase in uncertainty and trading volume, along with a decline in the U.S. stock market—regardless of the tweet’s content. However, the effect was stronger when Trump used confrontational words such as “tariff” or “trade war.” Some of his announcements also influenced the U.S. dollar exchange rate (l) and certain market indices within minutes of the tweet being posted (r)(a). Other scholars have shown that negative Trump’s tweets about specific companies tended to reduce demand for their stocks (b)(g), whereas some other have shown that they also impact market volatility indices such as the VIX (w) or the Volfele(v). The effects of his tweets also extended beyond the U.S.. For example, Nishimura &amp; Sun (2025) shows a positive relationship between volatility in European stock markets and tweeter activity of Trump, and this effect tends to intensify as public intention for his tweet grows (z).

We downloaded one-minute invervall data on multiple Indices, notably the S&amp;P 500 ETF with the Ticker SPY from Alphavantage. Then we calculated hourly volatility for these indices. Since trading starts at 09:30 the interval from 09:00 to 10:00 only includes half an hour of actual trading. The formula for hourly volatility is… 2.2 Political Data We source Trumps Posts from two places. The Tweets are from Kaggle Donald Trump Tweets Dataset (n.d.) and go until the 8th of January 2021. Since he switched his primary Posting platform to Truth Social we use only that Data from 2021 onwards. All Truth Social Posts were scrapped from trumpstruth.org, a webpage that aims to conserve all his posts. You can find the dataset, and webscrapper, and Data cleaning process in the Appendix. Since we’re using financial data that is constrained by trading hours, we decided to move posts after 16:00 to the next trading day’s opening hour.2 All tweets then get aggregated on the hour. We then extract a dummy if he posted in the hour, how many times he posted and how many times he mentioned certain words. Further we applied some simple sentiment analysis algorithms on the data to see if there are certain sentiments in his tweets that move the markets. More information and detailed process are in the appendix and online. 2.3 Final Dataframe Show here maybe?? References Donald Trump Tweets Dataset.
