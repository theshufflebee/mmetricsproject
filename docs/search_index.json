We asses the impact of posts on hourly volatility using ARMA-X. We evaluate multiple time horizons and independent variables, such as if Trump posts anything, specific words such as tariff and sentiments. We then calculate IRFs and show that there are significant impacts on volatility. "],["introduction.html", "Part 1 Introduction 1.1 Literature Review", " Part 1 Introduction Over the past 15 years social media has become an important communication tool for politicians. One of the pioneers of this novel approach has been Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th President of the United States. Since his ban on Twitter after the January 6th riots, his quantity of social media posts has drastically increased. This is shown in the following figure. 1 The content of his posts can sometimes have announcements or teases of future political decisions. Note the recent infamous “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” post sent just an hour before lifting his reciprocal tariffs. It is then not improbable that agents in financial markets might take this information into account in their decision making. This question has been asked before in the literature, focusing rather on his first term. This brings us to our research question: Do Donald Trumps Posts impact market Volatility? 1.1 Figure 1.1: Terminally Online: Trump’s Twitter &amp; Truth Social Posts (EDT) 1.1 Literature Review Information is one of the most valuable assets in the financial market. Its importance lies at the core of the “Efficient Market Hypothesis”, which states that the prices of assets fully reflect all available information, adjusting immediately to any new data Fama et al. (2003) , and thereby creating a strong demand for information flow. In addition, the “Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis” states that the release of new information is closely linked to movements in both realized and implied volatility (1)(3)(7). Consequently, a large part of the literature had focused on the relation between announcements, news and market activity. For example, Schumaker &amp; Chen (2009) use various linguistic and textual representations derived from financial news to predict stock market prices. Similarly, Ederington &amp; Lee (1993) analyze the impact of macroeconomic news announcements on interest rate and foreign exchange futures markets, particularly in terms of price changes and volatility. Both studies, among others, find that prices— such as stock prices—react primarily within minutes after the release of new information. Recently, the world has witnessed the rise of the Internet which revolutionized the dissemination and accessibility of information. Social media enable investors, analysts or politicians to instantly share their information, news or opinions. This led some studies to focus on the communication dynamics of social platform to predict changes in the returns of financial assets (6)(8). In this context, the impact of Trump’s tweets on various financial and macroeconomic variables has been analysed by several studies, especially during his first mandate. Using high-frequency financial data, Gjerstad et al. (2021) found an increase in uncertainty and trading volume, along with a decline in the U.S. stock market—regardless of the tweet’s content. However, the effect was stronger when Trump used confrontational words such as “tariff” or “trade war.” Some of his announcements also influenced the U.S. dollar exchange rate (l) and certain market indices within minutes of the tweet being posted (r)(a). Other scholars have shown that negative Trump tweets about specific companies tended to reduce demand for their stocks (b)(g), whereas some other have shown that they also impact market volatility indices such as the VIX (w) or the Volfele(v). The effects of his tweets also extended beyond the U.S.. For example, Nishimura &amp; Sun (2025) shows a positive relationship between volatility in European stock markets and tweeter activity of Trump, and this effect tends to intensify as public intention for his tweet grows (z).

While the actual indices do not update their prices so often, we had to take proxies under the form of ETF’s that track them. Our 3 markets of analysis are: SPY to track the S&amp;P500, VGK to track the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, and finally ASHR to track the CSI 300 China. We accessed this data through a free stock API, Alpha Vantage. Our timeframe is from the first of January 2014 to the 7th of May 2025. We then had to transform this data to get our main variable of interest, Average Hourly Volatility (AHV). Note that this is realised market volatility. We did so with the following formula: \\[ \\begin{aligned} v_t = \\frac{1}{N}&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^N(\\Delta p_{t,i})^2 \\end{aligned} \\] Where \\(\\Delta p_t\\) is the difference in price (open - close) and \\(i\\) represents every minute. We used a custom function in order to get the AHV for each open market hour. Note that the first hour is from 9:30 am to 10:00 am since the market open on a half-hour but closes at 4:00 pm. We can plot this data in figX . 2.2 Political Data We have two sources for Trump’s posts. The Tweets are from Kaggle (DonaldTrumpTweets?) and go until the 8th of January 2021. Since he switched his primary Posting platform to Truth Social we use only that Data from 2021 onwards. All Truth Social Posts were scrapped from trumpstruth.org, a webpage that aims to conserve all his posts. You can find the dataset, and webscrapper, and Data cleaning process in the Appendix. Since we’re using financial data that is constrained by trading hours, we decided to move posts after 16:00 to the next trading day’s opening hour. A big problem we had in our analysis was what to do with social media posts which appeared outside market hours. We first decided to simply ignore them, but it turned out to remove a lot of observations. We finally decided to push all the social media information outside market hours to the next open hour. This comes as an assumption.2 Since our financial data is hourly, we aggregate the social data by hour. We then construct multiple variables from the social media data. These include a dummy for whether there was a post, the number of posts an hour and counts for certain words (“tariffs”,“trade”,“china”). Further we applied some simple sentiment analysis algorithms on the data to see if there are certain sentiments in his tweets that move the markets. More information and detailed process are in the appendix and online. insert wordcloud . 2.3 Final Dataframe Table 2.1: timestampSPY_volVGK_volASHR_vol 2025-05-06 10:00:000.04660.0007315.32e-05 2025-05-06 11:00:000.02780.0002173.33e-05 2025-05-06 12:00:000.08590.0004683e-05        2025-05-06 13:00:000.04570.0004573.26e-05 2025-05-06 14:00:000.03360.0002242.24e-05 2025-05-06 15:00:000.05170.0002952.03e-05 Table 2.1: dummyNtarifftradechina 00000 00000 13020 15000 11000 00000 Table 2.1: prop_angerprop_anticipationprop_disgustprop_fearprop_joy 0     0     0     0    0    0     0     0     0    0    0.09090.04550.09090.2270    0.087 0.087 0     0.13 0.13 0     0     0     0    0    0     0     0     0    0    Table 2.1: prop_sadnessprop_surpriseprop_trustprop_negativeprop_positive 0     0    0    0    0     0     0    0    0    0     0.04550.1360.3640.5560.444 0.04350.0870.4350.1760.824 0     0    0    0    0     0     0    0    0    0     ¨ 3: For instance, if Trump tweets on Good Friday (market holiday), then the market will only react to this new information on Monday at 9:30 am. 2↩︎ 2↩︎ "],["arma-x.html", "Part 3 ARMA-X 3.1 Methodology 3.2 Results", " Part 3 ARMA-X 3.1 Methodology Once we have our final dataframe, we could then finally start on some analysis. We first thought of a simple ARMA-X type specification, taking the AHV as our “y variable” and taking any of the social media variables as the exogenous regressors. The assumption here is that, while the market reacts to Trump posts, Trump’s posts are chaotic, nonsensical, and random enough to be considered exogenous. We of course first start by checking stationarity of our variables (ADF), where we find p-values of 0.01 suggesting that the processes are not explosive. Then, we use a custom function in order to choose the number of lags based on the AIC criterion. This however, while often choose a very high number of lags, which could be explained by our data being hourly. As such we decided to put a limit of 3 lags, which sees minimal AIC loss and simplifying our models considerably. 3.2 Results 10.4 3.2.1 Full Timeframe We run models with the following exogenous regressors: \\(TweetDummy\\), \\(TweetCount\\), and the mentions of words \\(Tariff\\), \\(Trade\\), and \\(China\\). We first note on ARMAX Table 1 that all the x-regressors are significant, apart from trade. Notice also that all the coefficients (apart from \\(Tariff_{t-3}\\)) are positive, in line with our main hypothesis. The effect of \\(Tariff_{t-1}\\) and \\(Tariff_{t-2}\\) are especially large, given the usual size of the volatility ( ARMAX Table 4 ). We in fact predict that an extra mention of tariffs one hour ago, leads to a whopping extra 0.02 in volatility which is just about the average size for the full timeframe. We can see the impulse response function (IRF) for this shock, in IRFtarif . Notice that there is a large response in the first periods, and then a graduate decline over time. Something to note is that in our analysises of IRF’s, when including MA terms, the decline shows up gradual while being much sharper when only including AR terms. Note that we ran all these models on the VGK and ASHR ETF’s as well, though no signficant results appear apart from a small but statistically significant effect of the tariff variable for VGK. 3.2.2 Split Samples We then split our sample for the first and second term of the Trump presidancy. We only run models on tariff, trade and china this time. As seen on table ARMAX Table 2 , the first interesting result is in the coefficients of tariff being significant and very large in the second term, while being small and not statistically significant in the first. A similar story goes for the China variable. This may lend some evidence to support the claim that investors are much more reactive to Trump’s social media presence now than before. Finally, we can check the residuals of all these models to test them somewhat. On ARMAX Table 3 , the pvalues being zero for the full timeframe and first term indicate that there is autocorrelation in the residuals, thus suggesting that these estimations have problems. Note however, that the pvalues for the second term are quite high, lending support to our models on the split sample. These results suggest that perhaps ARMA-X models are not right in this context, as it is not unreasonable to think that Trump does in fact react to market movements. With this information, we decided to run a VAR model to deepen our understanding of these variables. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD ======= &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8ef96175d79b5bd3e2aa79f94b0965dea34f62e5 "],["var.html", "Part 4 VAR 4.1 Methodology 4.2 Results", " Part 4 VAR 4.1 Methodology 4.2 Results 4.2.1 Full Timeframe 4.2.2 Split Samples "],["conclusion.html", "Part 5 Conclusion", " Part 5 Conclusion "],["bibliography.html", "Part 6 Bibliography References", " Part 6 Bibliography References "],["appendix.html", "Part 7 Appendix", " Part 7 Appendix "],["full-timeframe-jan-2024-to-may-2025.html", "Part 8 Full Timeframe (Jan 2024 to May 2025) 8.1 SPY Models 8.2 SPY Table 8.3 SPY IRFs 8.4 SPY Residuals", " Part 8 Full Timeframe (Jan 2024 to May 2025) #load final dataset source(here(&quot;helperfunctions/full_data.R&quot;)) #backup backup = data #select timeframe data = filter(data,between(timestamp, as.Date(&#39;2014-01-01&#39;), as.Date(&#39;2025-05-07&#39;))) #for interpretation mean1 = mean(data$SPY_vol) 8.1 SPY Models We choose the specification in the armax_models file.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 12. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 12.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
