# ARMA-X

## Methodology

Once we have our final dataframe, we could then finally start on some analysis.
We first thought of a simple ARMA-X type specification, taking the AHV as our
"y variable" and taking any of the social media variables as the exogenous
regressors. The assumption here is that, while the market reacts to Trump posts,
Trump's posts are chaotic, nonsensical, and random enough to be considered 
exogenous. 

We of course first start by checking stationarity of our variables (ADF), where we find
p-values of 0.01 suggesting that the processes are not explosive. Then, we use 
a custom function in order to choose the number of lags based on the AIC criterion.
This however, while often choose a very high number of lags, which could be 
explained by our data being hourly. As such we decided to put a limit of 3 lags,
which sees minimal AIC loss and simplifying our models considerably.

## Results


### Full Timeframe
We run models with the following exogenous regressors: $TweetDummy$, $TweetCount$,
and the mentions of words $Tariff$, $Trade$, and $China$. We first note on the table
 in section \@ref(sec:spy-table) that all the x-regressors are significant,
apart from trade. Notice also that all the coefficients (apart from $Tariff_{t-3}$)
are positive, in line with our main hypothesis. The effect of $Tariff_{t-1}$ and 
$Tariff_{t-2}$ are especially large, given the usual size of the volatility as seen
in Section \@ref(sec:means-table). We in fact predict that an 
extra mention of tariffs one hour ago, leads to a whopping extra 0.02 in volatility
 which is just about the average size for the full timeframe. We can see the
impulse response function (IRF) for this shock in Section \@ref(sec:SPY-IRF).
Notice that there is a large response in the first periods, and then a graduate
decline over time. Something to note is that in our analysises of IRF's, when including
MA terms, the decline shows up gradual while being much sharper when only including
AR terms. 
Note that we ran all these models on the VGK and ASHR ETF's as well, though no
signficant results appear apart from a small but statistically significant effect
of the tariff variable for VGK.

### Split Samples
We then split our sample for the first and second term of the Trump presidancy.
We only run models on tariff, trade and china this time. As seen on the table in
Section \@ref(sec:spy-table-terms), the first interesting result
is in the coefficients of tariff being significant and very large in the second
term, while being small and not statistically significant in the first. A similar
story goes for the China variable. This may lend some evidence to support the 
claim that investors are much more reactive to Trump's social media presence
now than before. 
Finally, we can check the residuals of all these models to test them somewhat. 
In Section \@ref(sec:SPY-res-test), the pvalues being zero
for the full timeframe and first term indicate that there is autocorrelation in 
the residuals, thus suggesting that these estimations have problems. Note however,
that the pvalues for the second term are quite high, lending support to our
models on the split sample. These results suggest that perhaps ARMA-X models are
not right in this context, as it is not unreasonable to think that Trump does 
in fact react to market movements. With this information, we decided to run
a VAR model to deepen our understanding of these variables.
