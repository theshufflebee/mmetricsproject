# Abstract {.unnumbered}

In this short paper, we aim to asses to what extent financial markets may react
to Donald Trump's social media posts, and specifically the effect on average
realised volatility. We do so using both ARMA-X and VAR models, with data spanning
the 1st of January 2014, to the 7th of May 2025, over various time horizons and
independent variables. We find limited evidence that there is a significant positive
effect, and provide some explanations as to why this could be the case.
