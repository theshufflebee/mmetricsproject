# About

This is a Website for a class project from the 2025 Class Macroeconometrics at Universit√© de Lausanne.

## Usage 

You can find all sections on the left. There is the Main Report which we hand in. This serves as a complete collection of the whole project to make sure everything is available to readers.

# Abstract 

This Project assesses to what extent Financial Markets react to information provided by Donald Trump on either Twitter (now known as X) and Truth Social. We asses the impact of posts on hourly volatility using ARMA-X. We evaluate multimple tie horizons and independent variables, such as if Trump posts anything, specific words such as tariff and sentiments. We then calculate IRFS and show that there are significant impacts on volatility.
