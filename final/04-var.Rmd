# SVAR 

## Methodology

We develop an SVAR model in order to assess the impact of
short-run shocks from Trump's posts on AHV, and to evaluate whether
market volatility can, in turn, influence Trump's posting behaviour. In
this framework, we systematically pair AHV with one explanatory variable
at a time (our x-regressor). The SVAR approach offers the advantage of accounting for
structural endogeneity. Our main assumption is that the volatility
does not contemporaneously affect Trump's posting activity - neither
quantitatively nor qualitatively - while Trump's posts do affect markets instantly. 
In essence, we impose a short-run restriction on the shock of volatility for all the
social media variables.

Based on the information criteria, we found similar results across all
specifications, with a recommended lag length of around 70. However,
including more than 6 lags (corresponding to a full trading day)
introduces strong seasonal patterns. Moreover, the higher the number of lags,
the greater the persistence of a shock up to unrealistic levels such as 150 days 
for the number of Tweets, which seems implausible. Therefore, we chose to fix the
number of lags at a maximum of 6. Finally, given the presence of heteroscedasticity
and serial correlation in the residuals, we use the Newey-West estimator
to compute robust standard errors. Our specification is built as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t = c + \Phi_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots +
\Phi_6 y_{t-6} + B \eta_t, \hspace{0.2cm} \text{where:} \hspace{0.2cm}
y_t =
\begin{bmatrix}
X_t \\
AHV_t
\end{bmatrix},
 \quad B =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & 0 \\
b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\eta_t =
\begin{bmatrix}
\eta^{X}_t \\
\eta^{AHV}_t
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Results

### Full Timeframe


As in the ARMA-X framework, we initially estimate a model for each of our five
main variables across the full dataset. Table (\@ref(sec:svar-table-1)) shows all estimations using the SPY ETF, where
we notice that the positive coefficients (of the social media variables) are large 
but not statistically significant. Oddly, the only significant coefficients are
consistently negative.

For the $Tariff$, $Trade$ and $China$ variables, the first, second and sometimes fourth 
lags are positive and relatively large (especially in the case of $Tariff$), while 
the remaining ones are not. In contrast, for $TweetCount$ and $TweetDummy$, we 
observe fewer and smaller positive coefficients. At the same time, we find 
that the contemporaneous effects of the shocks are all positive and relatively 
strong. This leads to two types of scenarios : either 
the IRFs experience a positive shock and remain elevated ($Tariff$, $Trade$ and $China$), 
or a highly positive shock occurs, but the cumulative effect turns negative after a few 
hours ($TweetDummy$ and $TweetCount$). You can find the IRFs for $Tariff$ on Figures
(\@ref(sec:irf-dummy), \@ref(sec:irf-tariff)).

Finally, apart for $Tariff$, all Granger causality tests indicate that Trump's 
posts Granger-cause volatility. However, due to serial correlation in the 
residuals, these results should be interpreted with extreme caution. Overall, this model 
suggests that Trump's posts tend to have a positive instantaneous effect on 
volatility, but with very low persistence.
When analyzing the VGK \& ASHR ETFs, we observe similar patterns 
though with lower magnitude, except for the impact of $Tariff$ and $China$ on 
ASHR, where the cumulative effects show no positive impact. Additionally, 
the VGK ETF appears to react more strongly than ASHR to 
Trump's posts, especially those mentioning $Trade$ and $Tariff$.

Regarding the impact of AHV on Trump's posts, we find some evidence of a 
negative effect. For all variables, we observe one or two significantly 
negative coefficients, typically on the first and fourth lag, alongside many 
insignificant ones. However, only $TweetCount$ and $China$ pass the Granger test in 
the SPY ETF. Surprisingly, a large number of Granger tests in the VGK and 
ASHR ETFs indicate strong Granger causality, which may point to a limitation 
of the test itself as such results appear unrealistic. 


### Split Sample

Tables (\@ref(sec:tab-svar-1)), (\@ref(sec:tab-svar-2)) show the models for the split terms,
where we notice the results are strikingly similar. While we
observe relatively small shock effects and almost entirely negative coefficients 
during the first term, (which explain why the 
cumulative IRFs indicate a negative impact of posts), the shock effects in the
second term are substantially larger, ranging from 5 times (for $TweetCount$ and 
$TweetDummy$) to as much as 25 times greater (for $Tariff$). The only exception is 
$Trade$ in the second term, which shows the only negative impact from a shock.
Once again we find positive lagged coefficients in the second term, mostly on 
the first, second and fourth lags. However, none of these coefficients are
statistically significant though the cumulative IRFs clearly show a high positive 
impact on everything except for $TweetDummy$ and $TweetCount$, whose
coefficients and cumulative IRFs display similar patterns to those observed 
in the first term (such as \@ref(sec:irf-china-2)). 

Moreover, the Granger tests generally failed in both terms, with the sole
exception being $China$ in the second term. 
Regarding the ASHR ETF, we found results similar to those for SPY. Surprisingly, 
in the case of VGK, we observe a positive
impact of Trumpâ€™s posts on AHV during the first term. Nevertheless, the results 
still indicate a stronger impact of posts during the second term.
