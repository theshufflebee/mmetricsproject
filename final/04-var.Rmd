# SVAR 

## Methodology

We develop a SVAR model in order to assess the impact of
short-run shocks from Trump's posts on AHV, and to evaluate whether
market volatility can, in turn, influence Trump's posting behavior. In
this framework, we systematically pair AHV with one explanatory variable
at a time (our X-regressor). The SVAR approach offers the advantage of accounting for
structural endogeneity. Our main assumption is that the volatility
does not contemporaneously affect Trump's posting activity - neither
quantitatively nor qualitatively, while Trump's posts do affect markets instantly. 
In essence, we impose a short-run restriction on the shock of volatility for all the
social media variables.

Based on the information criteria, we found similar results across all
specifications, with a recommended lag length of around 70. However,
inducing more than 6 lags (corresponding to a full trading day)
introduces strong seasonality. Moreover, the higher the number of lags,
the greater the persistence of a shock, up to unrealistic levels such as 150 days 
for the number of Tweets, which seems implausible. Therefore, we chose to fix the
number of lags at a maximum of 6. Finally, given the presence of heteroscedasticity
and serial correlation in the residuals, we use the Newey-West estimator
to compute robust standard errors.


## Results

### Full Timeframe


As in the ARMA-X framework, we initially estimate a model for each of our five
main variables. For all estimations using the SPY ETF market, the significant 
coefficients of social media variables were consistently negative, while the 
positive coefficients were large but not significant \@ref(sec:svar-table-1).
([*desc1figVAR*]{style="color:red"})
For the $Tariff$, $Trade$ and $China$ mention variables, the first, second and sometimes forth 
lag were positive and relatively large (especially in the case of Tariff), while 
the remaining ones were not. In contrast, for $TweetCount$ and $TweetDummy$, we 
observed fewer and smaller positive coefficients. At the same time, we found 
that the contemporaneous effects of the shocks were all positive and relatively 
strong. This leads to two types of scenarios : either 
the IRF's experienced a positive shock and remain elevated ($Tariff$, $Trade$ and $China$), 
or a highly positive shock occurs, but the cumulative effect turns negative after few 
hours ($TweetDummy$ and $Count$). \@ref(sec:irf-dummy), \@ref(sec:irf-cum-dummy)

Finally, except for $Tariff$, all Granger causality tests indicate that Trump's 
posts have an impact on volatility. However, due to serial correlation in the 
residuals, these results should be interpreted with caution. Overall, this model 
suggest that Trump's posts tend to have a positive instantaneous effect on 
volatility, but with very low persistence.
When analyzing the European and Chinese ETF's, we observe similar patterns 
though with lower magnitude, except for the impact of $Tariff$ and $China$ on the 
ASHR ETF (Chinese Market), where the cumulative effects show no positive impact. Additionally, 
the VGK ETF (European Market) appears to react more strongly than ASHR to 
Trump's posts, especially those mentioning $Trade$ and $Tariff$.

Regarding the impact of AHV on Trump's posts, we find some evidence of a 
negative effect. For all variables, we observe one or two significantly 
negative coefficients per variables, typically on the first and fourth lag, alongside many 
insignificant ones. However, only $TweetCount$ and China pass the Granger test in 
the US ETF Surprisingly, a large number of Granger tests in the Chinese and 
European ETFs indicate strong Granger causality, which may point to a limitation 
of the test itself, as such results appear unrealistic. 


### Split Sample

For the split framework, the results were similar and striking \@ref(sec:irf-china-2)
[*IRFchinasecondtermVAR*]{style="color:red"}. While we
observed relatively small shock effects and almost entirely negative coefficients 
during the first term \@ref(sec:tab-svar-1) ([*descFirsttermfigVAR*]{style="color:red"}), leading the 
cumulative IRF's to indicate a negative impact of posts, the shock effects in the
second term were substantially larger, ranging from 5 times (for $TweetCount$ and 
$TweetDummy$) to as much as 25 times greater (for $Tariff$). the only exception was 
$Trade$ in the second term, which showed the only negative impact from a shock.
Once again, we found positive lagged coefficients in the second term, mostly on 
the first, second and forth lags. However, none of these coefficients were
statistically significant, but the cumulative IRF's clearly show a high positive 
impact on everything except for $TweetDummy$ and $TweetCount$, whose
coefficients and cumulative IRF's displayed similar patterns to those observed 
in the first term. \@ref(sec:tab-svar-2) ([*descSecondtermfigVAR*]{style="color:red"})
Moreover, the Granger tests generally failed in both terms, with the sole
exception being $China$ in the second term. 
Regarding the ASHR ETF, we found results similar to those for the US ETF. Surprisingly, 
in the case of the European market, we observed a positive
impact of Trumpâ€™s posts on AHV during the first term. Nevertheless, the results 
still indicate a stronger impact of posts during the second term.
