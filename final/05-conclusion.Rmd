# Conclusion

We started this project with the intention of understanding whether the impact 
of Trump's social media posts affect financial markets, and to see if there
is perhaps a difference from his first presidential mandate. After various 
headaches with our data, we first ran ARMA-X models where we found significant
and positive results albeit with strong auto-correlation in the errors, with only
the second term analysis offering more convincing results. We then try VAR models
for a possibly more accurate picture, albeit with little to no success. We once
again find strong auto-correlation in the errors, which we here fix by using 
Newey-West standard errors. We found that the only significant coefficients are
actually negative, suggesting Trump's social media presence would reduce volatility.

However, we would suggest strong against trying to interpret these results given
that the models seem to not fit particularly well. This may be due to seasonality
in our data (a common trend seen is our daily AVH is high volatility in the first 
open hours, and a gradual slowdown for the rest of the day), or to our handling 
of non-market hours. Further work could look at exploring said issues in greater depth,
further complicate the models by adding more variables and interactions between them,
and/or additionally <span style="color:red"> *use more sophisticated models, such as models including co-integration.* </span>
