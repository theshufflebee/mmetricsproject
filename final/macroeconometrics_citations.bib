Using text mining techniques, some correlation is found between various moving average window lengths of tweet content and the DJI index. Some short term and lasting effects are also detected on US-Canada and US composite exchange rates.},

We find these announcements are responsible for most of the observed time-of-day and day-of-the-week volatility patterns in these markets. While the bulk of the price adjustment to a major announcement occurs within the first minute, volatility remains substantially higher than normal for roughly fifteen minutes and slightly elevated for several hours. Nonetheless, these subsequent price adjustments are basically independent of the first minute's return. We identify those announcements with the greatest impact of these markets.}

  abstract = {We compare the optimal trading strategy of an informed speculator when he can trade ahead of incoming news (is ``fast''), versus when he cannot (is ``slow''). We find that speed matters: the fast speculator's trades account for a larger fraction of trading volume, and are more correlated with short-run price changes. Nevertheless, he realizes a large fraction of his profits from trading on long-term price changes. The fast speculator's behavior matches evidence about high-frequency traders. We predict that stocks with more informative news are more liquid even though they attract more activity from informed high-frequency traders.},

We use realized volatility and the HAR-RV model to examine the effect of Trump's tweets on the stock market volatility in Germany, France, and the UK during his last presidential term. Results indicate that Trump's tweets positively impact volatilities in European stock markets, with these impacts increasing as attention to his tweets rises. The effect on the UK stock market is relatively weaker. The empirical results indicate that Trump's tweets influence global stock markets beyond the US.},

  abstract = {Our research examines a predictive machine learning approach for financial news articles analysis using several different textual representations: bag of words, noun phrases, and named entities. Through this approach, we investigated 9,211 financial news articles and 10,259,042 stock quotes covering the S\&amp;P 500 stocks during a five week period. We applied our analysis to estimate a discrete stock price twenty minutes after a news article was released. Using a support vector machine (SVM) derivative specially tailored for discrete numeric prediction and models containing different stock-specific variables, we show that the model containing both article terms and stock price at the time of article release had the best performance in closeness to the actual future stock price (MSE 0.04261), the same direction of price movement as the future price (57.1\% directional accuracy) and the highest return using a simulated trading engine (2.06\% return). We further investigated the different textual representations and found that a Proper Noun scheme performs better than the de facto standard of Bag of Words in all three metrics.}
